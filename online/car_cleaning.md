    * Let it sit for a few minutes to loosen the sticky residue.

**Important Notes:**

* **Avoid harsh chemicals:** Never use abrasive cleaners, solvents, or bleach on your dashboard. They can damage the surface.
* **Test in an inconspicuous area:** Before using any new cleaning product, test it in an inconspicuous area to ensure it doesn't damage the dashboard material.
* **Protect from sunlight:** Direct sunlight can cause your dashboard to fade and crack. Use a sunshade to protect it when parked.
